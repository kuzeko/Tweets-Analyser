\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

We downloaded 33 milion of US tweets from the tweet-stream using the streaming APIs\footnote{\url{https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis}} on a period of two weeks from December 18, 2012 to January 18, 2013. 
A summary of the main characteristic of the dataset is represented in table~\ref{tbl:dataset}.
The number of users is 16 milion, with an average of 2 tweets per user. 
The number of hashtags is one order of magnitude less than the number of tweets meaning that users often talk about same topics.
From this dataset we generated three datasets \textsc{100k-Tweets}, \textsc{1M-Tweets}, \textsc{10M-Tweets} with 100k,1 milion and 10 milion tweets respectively, in order to test performance with various sizes. 
We also downloaded a dictionary of 213k English words to filter the meanngful tweets from those irrelevant or containing only symbols. 
To perform the sentiment analysis and (i.e., to assign a positive or negative polarity to the tweets) we used the senti-strength\footnote{\url{http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/}} library.
