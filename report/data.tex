\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

We downloaded 33 milion of English tweets from the tweet-stream using the streaming APIs\footnote{\url{https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis}} on a period of approximately two weeks from December 18, 2012 to January 18, 2013~\footnote{We didn't downloaded any data durig the week between the 25-12-2012 and the 2-1-2013}. 
A summary of the main characteristic of the dataset is represented in table~\ref{tbl:dataset}.
The number of users is 16 milion, with an average of 2 tweets per user. 
The number of hashtags is one order of magnitude less than the number of tweets meaning that users often talk about same topics.
From this dataset we generated three datasets \textsc{100k-Tweets}, \textsc{1M-Tweets}, \textsc{10M-Tweets} with 100 thousands,1 million and 10 million tweets respectively, in order to test performance with various sizes of the dataset. 
We also downloaded a dictionary of 213 thousands English words to filter the meaningful tweets from those irrelevant or containing only symbols. 
To perform the sentiment analysis and (i.e., to assign a positive or negative polarity to the tweets) we used the SentiStrength library.
