\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The ability to perform various statistical analyses with twitter has been attracted many research in the last few years~\cite{Hong:2012qy,Lehmann:2012kx} and used to influence politics~\cite{Tumasjan:2010vn} and advertising~\cite{Bakshy:2011ys}. 
This important trend must be taken into account, but the huge amount of information per day cannot be processed by a single machine. 
To this end, we propose a schema based on PACT paradigm implemented in Stratosphere, that is a enhanced map-reduce system able, to mix second order functions. 
Our goal is to conduct an analysis of a big dataset, automatically downloaded using the Twitter streaming APIs.
