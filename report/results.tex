\section{Experimental evaluation}
\label{sec:results}
We tested our solution with Stratosphere 0.2\footnote{\url{https://stratosphere.eu/downloads}} running on a GNU\\Linux machine with 2Gb RAM DDR2, and a CPU AMD Athlon\texttrademark 64bit X2 Dual Core Processor 5000+ running on Linux kernel 3.0.0-12\footnote{Linux 3.0.0-12-generic #20-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux}. 
All the experiments have been performed on samples of the original database, in order to show time and quality performance. 
We used Java JRE 1.6.0\_26 to program the PACT using the Stratosphere libraries and server, additionally we integrated the SentiStrength java library\footnote{\url{http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/}}. 
We performed preliminary experiments to set the english word threshold and we finally set it to 0.1 in order not to prune to much. 
Since we are matching with english words that are not stemmed a larger threshold removes interesting tweets.
