===============

Stratosphere PACT Program to run statistics over Tweets

It parses tweets records, collecting statistics about hashtag evolution over time.

![Tweets-Analyser in action](https://raw.github.com/kuzeko/Tweets-Analyser/master/report/images/obama-sentiment.png "Sentiment Analysis")

It uses also a customized version of [SentiStrength](http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/), which needs to be downloaded separately from the official website.
SentiStrength Data dir is also needed, and the flow should be configured accordingly


Configuration is present in the maven file.
